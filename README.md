# WiFi Sentinel 🛡️

A cross-platform Python network monitor that scans your WiFi for unknown
devices and sends instant desktop alerts. Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Built as a personal security tool after going through the process of securing
my home network and realizing I had no way of knowing when new devices connected.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install nmap
```

**Windows:**
Download nmap from https://nmap.org/download.html
Make sure to check "Add to PATH" during installation.

**Linux:**

```bash
sudo apt install nmap
```

### 2. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abrinson808/wifi-sentinel.git
cd wifi-sentinel
```

### 3. Create a virtual environment

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Run the setup wizard

```bash
python setup.py
```

This will install all dependencies and create your config file automatically.

### 5. Configure

Open `config.py` and set your network range:

**macOS:**

```bash
ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

**Windows:**

```bash
ipconfig
```

**Linux:**

```bash
ip addr
```

### 6. Run

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
# Manual scan
sudo venv/bin/python scanner.py

# Interactive mode (recommended)
sudo venv/bin/python scanner.py --interactive

# Run on a schedule
sudo venv/bin/python scheduler.py

# Launch the web dashboard (user friendly)
venv/bin/python dashboard.py
```

**Windows (Command Prompt as Administrator):**

```bash
# Manual scan
venv\Scripts\python scanner.py

# Interactive mode (recommended)
venv\Scripts\python scanner.py --interactive

# Run on a schedule
venv\Scripts\python scheduler.py

# Launch the web dashboard (user friendly)
venv\Scripts\python dashboard.py
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5001
```

## First Run

On first run, WiFi Sentinel will automatically scan your network and walk
you through building your whitelist device by device. For each device found
you will be asked:

1. Whether you recognize the device
2. To confirm or correct the vendor name
3. To give the device a name (ex: iPhone, PS5, Smart TV)

Any device you don't recognize is automatically saved to `flagged_devices.json`
for review. Devices you recognize are saved to your whitelist as trusted.
Press Enter on any field you don't know to skip it.

### Running in interactive mode

Interactive mode is recommended for day to day use. It scans your network and
prompts you to review any unknown devices directly from the terminal.

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
sudo venv/bin/python scanner.py --interactive
```

**Windows (Command Prompt as Administrator):**

```bash
venv\Scripts\python scanner.py --interactive
```

### Unknown device flow

When an unknown device is detected in interactive mode, WiFi Sentinel will:

1. Display the device's IP, MAC address, and vendor name
2. Ask if you recognize the device
3. If yes — let you confirm the vendor name and enter a device name
4. If no — flag it to flagged_devices.json and keep alerting on future scans
5. Any input other than 'y' defaults to flagging the device as unrecognized

### Silent scheduled mode

To run WiFi Sentinel silently in the background on a schedule:

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
sudo venv/bin/python scheduler.py
```

**Windows (Command Prompt as Administrator):**

```bash
venv\Scripts\python scheduler.py
```
